Project 3 for COP 5615
Team Members: Scott Slinn & Nick Costagliola

## What is working
We believe the chord algorithm is working as expected. The network initializes successfully with all finger tables and passes the query along successfully. We believe the main limiting factor in memory size is memory; testing for this project was performed with an M1 Macbook Pro with 8 gigs of memory. However, testing demonstrates expected logarithmic performance otherwise.

## Largest Network Size Achieved
The largest network size succefully tested contains 5000 nodes; this is a reduction in node count from prior projects, primarily due to a change in testing device with lower overall memory. Protocol performance remains consistent throughout, however.
